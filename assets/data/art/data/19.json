        "description": "<p>Basque artist Juanjo Novella&rsquo;s sculpture is the largest freestanding work on campus, measuring 20 metres long by three metres high. It resembles a sheet of paper with a &lsquo;torn&rsquo; edge along the top. This page represents university life as a place of reading, writing, experimentation and sketching out ideas.</p><p>Poet Laureate Simon Armitage's words &lsquo;to leaf is to learn&rsquo; are punched through the surface of the artwork, along with a leaf design referring to the mature sycamore tree nearby. This page represents the university as a place of reading, writing, experimentation and sketching out ideas.</p><p>Novella said: &lsquo;I like to imagine people around my sculptures, touching them, leaning on them, children playing. I want this work to be a living element that adds a sense of identity to the place where it is located.&rsquo;</p>",
