        "description": "Born in Wakefield in 1903, Barbara Hepworth is regarded as a pre-eminent British sculptor, along with her peer and fellow Yorkshire native, Henry Moore. In 1965, the year that she produced <strong>Dual Form</strong>, she was made Dame Commander of the British Empire (DBE) and was also made the first female trustee of the Tate Gallery.</p><p><strong>Dual Form</strong> is one of an edition of seven bronzes, a medium that Hepworth began working in towards the late 1950s. With its simple form and pierced hollows, it recalls Hepworthâ€™s earlier work in wood. The sculpture was acquired by the Leeds Art Fund in 1967 and is on loan from Leeds Art Gallery.",
