He is now based\nin Berlin. His first major British exhibition was at Tate St Ives in 2012.\n<br \/><br \/>\nFujiwara adopts a quasi-anthropological approach in his practice and this work is his first Public Art commission. The commissioning committee, which included student and staff representation, sought to create a new outstanding feature at the very entrance of the University, in front of the new Laidlaw Library. Fujiwara\u2019s work, A Spire, is a beacon and totem that evokes the industries on which the University, and indeed, the city,\nare largely built. A Spire is conceived as a soaring visual timeline \u2013 a skyward archaeology that connects the past and the present.\n<br \/><br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.leeds.ac.uk\/corporate\/images\/2_6.jpg\" \/>\n<br \/>\n Tall and cylindrical in form, A Spire is the third spire between two church buildings on Woodhouse Lane, drawing attention to the physical qualities of the site and creating a visually arresting moment on the campus. From the pulverised coal integrated at the base of the spire symbolising the coal on which Leeds\u2019s prosperity was built, to the branches and cables laid into the cast, the surface of intertwined natural and technological elements symbolises the current digital era in which organic and man-made materials merge. A Spire creates a unique new presence at the top of Woodhouse Lane, capturing an ever changing vertical landscape and the passing of time.<br><br><strong>What3Words<\/strong><br><a href=\"https:\/\/what3words.com\/object.focus.carry\">\/\/\/object.focus.carry<\/a>",

        "desc": "A controversial figure, the devoutly religious Gill was born in Sussex and initially trained to be an architect. He abandoned his studies in 1903, eventually establishing himself as a sculptor, producing works with precise linear simplicity. In 1914 he was commissioned to create the Stationsof the Cross for Westminster Cathedral. While working on these, Michael Sadler \u2013 then the University\u2019s Vice-Chancellor \u2013 approached him to discuss a war memorial for Leeds. Gill revived a proposal rejected by the London County Council to commemorate their war dead, a freestanding\nbronze of Jesus and the Moneychangers. \n<br \/><br \/>\nFor Leeds, Gill suggested a stone frieze, with Christ expelling a group of moneychangers from the temple\u2013 though with some in contemporary attire. In doing so, Gill was suggesting that the merchants of Leeds had profited from the war.\n<br \/><br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.leeds.ac.uk\/corporate\/images\/4_2.jpg\" \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\nGill\u2019s relief was carved in five sections and was initially installed prominently on the wall beneath the University\u2019s Great Hall. It was dedicated by the Bishop of Ripon on 1 June 1923. The subject matter was very different from that normally expected of memorials \u2013 soldiers or mourning angels \u2013 and caused immediate comment. The Yorkshire Post described it as a \u2018curious monument which... promises to create much controversy\u2019 and other local press agreed the work was \u2018bizarre\u2019, \u2018puzzling\u2019, \u2018strange\u2019 and \u2018not appropriate\u2019. Gill enjoyed the controversy and published his own defence of the work. Others rallied to defend it, including JRR Tolkien. Sadler himself steadfastly championed Gill\u2019s masterpiece as \u2018one of the finest things in modern\nart,\u2019 adding \u2018the carving will tell its own tale\u2019. Subsequently, the weather took its toll\non the work and ivy was allowed to grow over it, until the frieze was removed to a safer location in\nthe foyer of the Michael Sadler building in 1961.<br><br><strong>What3Words<\/strong><br><a href=\"https:\/\/what3words.com\/vent.epic.daring\">\/\/\/vent.epic.daring<\/a>",
