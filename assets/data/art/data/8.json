        "description": "<p>Lorna Green is a sculptor and environmental artist based in Cheshire. Her public art installations can be permanent or temporary and are often interactive. She did her MPhil at the University of Leeds and was a visiting lecturer from 1990 to 1997. In 1995 she was commissioned to create a sculpture for Chancellor&rsquo;s Court.</p><p><strong>Meet, Sit and Talk</strong> is made up of three stone circles, each stone bearing a rectangle of polished granite reflecting the sky and surroundings. Green explains the sculpture &lsquo;is intended to be used &ndash; for sitting, for meeting at and to create a socially interactive space&rsquo; and it is a popular meeting place on sunny days. Green redesigned the whole area with landscape architect Allan R. Ruff, who created a path recalling the flow of a river, the planting changing shape and colour with the seasons.</p>",
