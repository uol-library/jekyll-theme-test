        "description": "<p><strong>Sign for Art (Stelae 2014)</strong> references Keith Wilson&rsquo;s early career as an art instructor for deaf-blind adults in the 1980s. &ldquo;Drawing two spaced fingertips in a wave motion across the forehead of the student &ndash; a tactile brainwave sign &ndash; announced the arrival of the artist, the subject of art and the imminent activity of making art&rdquo;, the artist remembered. &ldquo;This modification of British Sign Language, presumably derived from the making of a brushstroke, struck home and stayed with me&rdquo;.</p><p>Now one of the most recognisable works on campus, at the centre of Beech Grove Plaza, the artwork has been given many affectionate nicknames by students, including &lsquo;The Squiggle&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Wavy Bacon&rsquo;.</p>",
