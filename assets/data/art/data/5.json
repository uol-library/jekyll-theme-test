        "description": "<p>Quentin Bell was the son of Vanessa and Clive Bell and nephew of Virginia Woolf. He is renowned as a ceramicist, and for his books on the Bloomsbury artists and a biography of Woolf. He was appointed Head of Fine Art at the University of Leeds in 1959, and later Professor of Fine Art. In 1978, Stanley Burton suggested acquiring a work by Bell for the Leeds campus.</p><p>Bell proposed a levitating figure â€“ a recurrent theme in his art inspired by a conjuror&rsquo;s trick he saw as a child. Stanley and the Vice-Chancellor, Lord Boyle, eventually decided on a site near the Edward Boyle Library. The work was cast in fibreglass with a steel armature, in an inter-disciplinary partnership with the Department of Civil  Engineering. Dr Gurdev Singh was responsible for the design and construction of the internal support and the Department oversaw the installation.</p><p>Unveiled by Stanley Burton in October 1982, it was later removed from its original site due to the Library&rsquo;s expansion. Commonly known on campus as &lsquo;The Dreamer&rsquo;, it is not clear when this title was acquired. It has also been called &lsquo;The Astral Lady&rsquo;, and Bell referred to it as the &lsquo;Elmdon Figure&rsquo;. Whatever its title or location, the artwork is one of the most popular on campus, and has become a site for personal pilgrimages and memorials.</p>",
