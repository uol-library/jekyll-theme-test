A place to break away from the pressures of the working day and enjoy a breather, a change of scenery, or even a chat with fellow professionals. Located at the heart of the innovation hub, the contemporary space provides a welcoming environment to relax and unwind. The perfect place for casual meetings or laidback lunches."
