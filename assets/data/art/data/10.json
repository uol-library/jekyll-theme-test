        "description": "<p>Lyons was born in Staffordshire and studied at Wolverhampton College of Art and the University of Newcastle. He was Head of Sculpture at Manchester Metropolitan University from 1989-93. He lived and worked in Yorkshire until his death in 2019. His large-scale public sculptures are sited in cities in China and Mexico and throughout Europe.</p><p>Made of steel plate sourced from scrapyards in Hull and Leeds, <strong>Lenten Cover</strong> was completed on Good Friday 1979. It reminded the artist of cloths covering church statues during Lent. This monumental piece creates a gateway from one place to another. It was exhibited across England and Wales before being purchased from the artist in 2019.</p>",
