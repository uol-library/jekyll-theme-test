        "description": "<p>Chattaway was born in Coventry and studied at Coventry School of Art and the Slade, before settling in Paris in 1950. The original <strong>Walking Figure</strong> was created in 1968 and is much influenced by Alberto Giacometti&rsquo;s figures of the 1950s and 60s. The original piece was conceived as part of a <strong>Triple Group</strong> (1968) with a seated figure and one lying horizontally.</p><p>Stanley Burton, who enjoyed a close friendship with Chattaway, was Chairman of Bodington Hall, the University&rsquo;s student residence located north of the main campus. Stanley commissioned this standing figure from the original group, for the grounds of Bodington Hall. In the 1980s, however, Walking Figure was severely damaged by students and one leg was destroyed beyond repair. Ever supportive of the University, Stanley asked Chattaway to recast the sculpture. This later cast is now displayed within Parkinson Court. When Bodington Hall closed in 2013, Stanley Burton displayed the damaged original sculpture in his garden.</p>",
